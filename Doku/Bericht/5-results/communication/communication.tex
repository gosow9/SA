\subsection{nRF52480}
The data transfer with the nRF52480 programmed as described is very simple.
The connection is stable in a similar range like the RFicient, and connecting the two devise after wakeup happens instantaneously.

\subsection{RFicient}
The development kit is a preliminary version which has to be sent back to the \acs{fraun} after evaluating.
Out of this reason, it was not possible to supply it directly from the super capacitor, because this would have involved soldering.
The kit was therefore supplied over \acs{usb} and it's power consumption assumed to be $4.5\,\mu \text{W}$ as stated in the datasheet.
Because the Rficient had to be controlled over the \acs{gui}, it was not possible to synchronize the wakeup event with the data transmission.
To ensure functionality, enough delay time (2\,s) between these two events was inserted.
With a fully synchronized transmitter, it should be possible to reduce the time, in which the microcontroller is in wakeup mode.
