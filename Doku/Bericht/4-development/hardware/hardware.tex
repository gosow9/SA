Figure \ref{hardware:block} shows the receiver schematics.
Every component is described in more detail in this section.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Display}
An 9.7\,inch (202.8\,mm $\times$ 139.425\,mm) e-paper display is used which adopts the microencapsulated electrophoretic display technology just as described in Chapter \ref{theory}.
It has a $1200\times 825$ resolution with 16 grey scales.
The IT8951, which is the display driver used on the evaluation board, drives the \acs{epd}. 
It can be accessed from a microcontroller with a \acs{spi}-bus \cite{waveshare}. 

\subsection{Communication}

\subsubsection{RFicient}

\paragraph{Transmitter}
As previously stated, the Rficient demo kit comes with a \acs{gui}.
Is the transmitter module connected, simple steps make it possible to set the preamble and payload data rate. 
The payload itself can partly serve as an ID and as additional transmitted data.
The power of the transmission can also be set between -30\,dBm and 10\,dBm.
The transmitter-\acs{gui} is shown in Figure \ref{development:tx}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/TXgui.png}
	\caption{Transmitter GUI.\label{development:tx}}
\end{figure}
To test if any data is received, it is helpful to activate the infinite loop (top right in Figure \ref{development:tx}).
In this case, the defined data is sent repeatedly with an adjustable period.

\paragraph{Receiver}
In order to receive the data, the setting of the receiver module has to match the transmitter.
The provided receiver-\acs{gui} makes this step very simple.
As visible in Figure \ref{development:rx}, one can enable the four possible interrupt sources: CodeA/B, ID, FIFO length and FIFO overflow.
In the finished product, it should be possible to wake up the receivers individually.
For this reason, only the ID as interrupt source is of interest.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/RXgui.png}
	\caption{Receiver GUI.\label{development:rx}}
\end{figure}
If an interrupt is generated, the RFicient sets a \acs{gpio}-pin to high, and transfers the received data to a \acs{fifo}-buffer.
This data can be passed to a microcontroller over an \acs{spi}-bus.
For the purpose of this thesis, only the \acs{gpio} high level is used to activate a self-holding circuit.

\paragraph{Tests in a realistic environment}
To test the RFicient in more detail, some indoor measurements were made.
As test environment served several buildings of the \acf{hsr}, since this type of facility represents a realistic condition for the developed schedule.

The purpose of the first test was to measure the achievable range.
Figure \ref{development:env1} shows the hallway where this test was executed.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/env/env1_c.pdf}
	\caption{Test environment 1 (\acs{hsr} building 1).\label{development:env1}}
\end{figure}
With a transmission power of 0\,dBm (1\,mW) it is possible to receive interrupts over a 50\,m distance (line of sight).
Is the transmission power increased to 10\,dBm (10\,mW), interrupts can be sent over a distance up to 80\,m.
In this environment, the Rficient has enough range.
However, there is the possibility that reflections off the walls, floor and ceiling had an influence on this result.

Due to this, a second test was performed to check how the RFicient penetrates obstacles.
As test environment served this time the \acs{hsr} builing 8, as depicted in Figure \ref{development:env2}.
An attempt was made to send wakeup signals through the ceiling.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/env/env2_c.pdf}
	\caption{Test environment 2 (\acs{hsr} building 8).\label{development:env2}}
\end{figure}
To avoid reflections, the RFicient was placed in such a way that the zero point of the antenna pointed directly at the opposite walls.
With a transmisson power of 0\,dBm, two ceilings can be penetrated.
Is the power again increased to 10\,dBm, the signal reached through three ceilings.

These measurements further confirmed that the RFicient is suitable for the use-case of this semester thesis.

\subsubsection{nRF52480}
A nRF52580 from nordic semiconductor serves as the wireless module.
It is used because it supports multiple protocols like Thread, Zigbee and, more important, Bluetooth 5, which includes \acf{ble}\cite{nrfpb}.
Since \acs{ble} allows mesh networking and is applied in many existing devices, such as smartphones, the connection to exchange data is established over this protocol.
This way, the developed prototype could later be extended to a mesh network.

Two nRF52480 development kits are used, one on the transmitter and one on the receiver end.
Data can be transferred from a computer with a \acs{usb}-\acs{ttl}-adapter to the \acs{uart}-interface of the transmitter development kit.
This data is then sent over \acs{ble} to the receiver kit and passed to the microcontroller again over \acs{uart}.
In the same way, data can be transferred from the receiver to the transmitter kit.
The data channel is therefore bi-directional. 

\subsection{Power Management}
Since the screen should be self-sustaining, some sort of energy-harvesting unit is needed.
It was apparent to choose light as the energy source, since the screen will be used in rooms, that are artificially illuminated most of the time.
The energy  obtained by solar cells is converted to a suitable voltage, using a ADP5090 chip.
This way, a super-capacitor, which is used as an energy storage device, is charged.

\subsubsection{Solar cell}
The solar-cell AM-1522 by Panasonic is used.
One panel has an area of $55.0\,\text{mm}\,\times\,40.5\,\text{mm}$ and delivers up to $57.8\, \mu\text{A}$ when operating at an optimal voltage of $2.1\,\text{V}$, provided an illuminance of 200\,lux.
To keep a reasonable display to panel ratio, four cells where parallelly connected, which corresponds to an area of ca. $89.1\,\text{cm}^2$ (Display area $\approx 283\,\text{cm}^2$). Therefore, the solar cells should provide a power of

\begin{align}
	P = U\cdot I = 4\cdot 57.8\,\mu\text{A}\cdot 2.1\ \text{V}=485.52\,\mu \text{W},\label{development:cell_power}
\end{align}

given a 200 lux illuminance \cite{amorton}.

\subsubsection{ADP5090}
The ADP5090 from Analog Devices is used to manage the energy harvesting process.
This boost regulator makes it possible to charge storage elements, such as rechargeable batteries and super capacitors with the input dc-power provided by the PV-cell. Utilized features are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Maximum power point tracking
	\item[-] Efficiency up to 90\%
	\item[-] Input voltage $V_{IN}$ from $80\,\text{mV}$ to $3.3\,\text{V}$
	\item[-] Programmable voltage range ($2.2\,\text{V}$ to $5.2\,\text{V}$) for the storage element
\end{itemize}
To prevent the storage element from overdischarging, the ADP5090 enables the user to set a maximal Voltage with resistors:

\begin{align}
	V_{\text{BAT\_TERM}} = \frac{3}{2} V_{\text{REF}}\left(1+\frac{R_{\text{TERM1}}}{R_{\text{TERM2}}} \right).\label{development:v_bat_term} 
\end{align} 

A similar procedure is applied to set a minimal voltage:

\begin{align}
	V_{\text{BAT\_SD}}=V_{\text{REF}} \left(1+\frac{R_{\text{SD1}}}{R_{\text{SD2}}} \right).\label{development:v_bat_sd} 
\end{align}  

While discharging, the ADP5090 will switch off the output $V_{\text{SYS}}$ if $V_{\text{BAT\_SD}}$ is reached. This prevents the storage element from overdischarging.
The output voltage $V_{\text{SYS}}$, where the load is attached, will therefore always stay in this programmed range $(V_{\text{BAT\_SD}}\le V_{\text{SYS}}\le V_{\text{BAT\_TERM}})$ \cite{adp}.

For this prototype, the evaluation board for the ADP5090 was used, where the internal reference voltage ($V_{\text{REF}}$ in \eqref{development:v_bat_term} and \eqref{development:v_bat_sd}) is $1.21\,\text{V}$ \cite{adp_eval}.

\subsubsection{Super capacitor}
As energy storage, a super capacitor from Taiyo Yuden (LIC1235RS3R8406) has proven to be suitable.
This is a $40\,\text{F}$ cylinder type lithium ion capacitor.
The operating voltage range is between $2.2\,\text{V}$ and $3.8\,\text{V}$.
Discharging the capacitor lower than $2.2\,\text{V}$ causes shorter lifetime and higher leakage current.
The same unwanted behaviour occurs when charging the capacitor over $3.8\,\text{V}$ \cites{yuden}.

\subsubsection{Combined test}
To test the behaviour of the power management, supercapacitor and solar cells, a couple of measurements are executed.
Figure \ref{development:test} shows the schematics of the test setup.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/testaufbau.pdf}
	\caption{Schematics of the test setup.\label{development:test}}
\end{figure}

To carry out these measurements, it is first necessary to adjust the minimal and maximal voltage of the ADP5090.
The nRF58240 accepts supply voltages between $1.6\,\text{V}$ up to $5.5\,\text{V}$ \cite{nrf}.
The STM32 on the other side is less flexible with an input voltage range of $1.71\,\text{V}$ to $3.6\,\text{V}$ \cite{stm32}.
As stated in the section above, the super capacitors operating voltage is between $2.2\,\text{V}$ and $3.8\,\text{V}$.
Hence it seems reasonable, to set $V_{\text{BAT\_TERM}} \le 3.6\,\text{V}$ and $V_{\text{BAT\_SD}} \ge 2.2\,\text{V}$, to satisfy all of these three elements.
In order to do this, the four resistors have to be chosen as $R_3 = 4.3\,\text{M}\Omega$, $R_6 = 4.7\,\text{M}\Omega$, $R_2 = 4.3\,\text{M}\Omega$ and $R_3 = 5.1\,\text{M}\Omega$.
Inserted in the equation \eqref{development:v_bat_term} and \eqref{development:v_bat_sd} we get
\begin{align}
	V_{\text{BAT\_TERM}}= \frac{3}{2} 1.21\,\text{V} \left(1 + \frac{4.3\,\text{M}\Omega}{4.7 \,\text{M}\Omega} \right) \approx 3.48\,\text{V} 
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
	V_{\text{BAT\_SD}} = 1.21\,\text{V} \left(1 + \frac{4.3\,\text{M}\Omega}{5.1\,\text{M}\Omega} \right) \approx 2.23\,\text{V}. 
\end{align}

While testing, the input voltage from the solar cells ($V_{\text{IN}}$), the supercap's voltage ($V_{\text{BAT}}$) and the output voltage ($V_{\text{SYS}}$) are tracked. Additionally, the illuminance ($E_\text{v}$) near the PV-cells  is recorded as indicated in figure \ref{development:test}.

The purpose of the first test is to check if the ADP5090 converts $V_{\text{IN}}$ to a voltage $\le V_{\text{BAT\_TERM}}$.
The measurements where taken over a couple hours and are plotted in Figure \ref{development:charge}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/laden.pdf}
	\caption{Charging behaviour.\label{development:charge}}
\end{figure}

No load was connected to the output ($Z_\text{LOAD} \to \infty$), which is the reason why $V_{\text{SYS}}$ is overlapped by $V_{\text{BAT}}$.
It can be seen that between 17:00 and 23:00, the super capacitor was being charged and
that the ADP5090 controls the voltage $V_{\text{BAT}}$ as expected to the adjusted maximum voltage $V_{\text{BAT\_TERM}}$.

The second test should simulate the discharging when a load is connected, after the capacitor was fully charged.
It was necessary to estimate the consumed power by the electronic components of the prototype.
A rough measurement with a power analyser showed that the microcontroller and the e-paper display together draw at its peak about $240\,\text{mA}$ when connected to $5\,\text{V}$. The nrf52840 on the other hand, only consumes 6 mA with a 3 V source. Thus the expected consumed power at is's peak is:
\begin{align}
	P_{e} = 5\,\text{V}\cdot 0.24\,\text{A} + 3\,\text{V}\cdot 0.006\,\text{A} = 1.218\,\text{W}.
\end{align}
  

If $Z_{\text{LOAD}}=10\,\Omega$ the load draws currents between $0.223\,\text{A}$ and $0.348\,\text{A}$, which again lead to a power consumption that should approximately match the power consumption of the finished prototype.
Furthermore, the solar cells where covered to observe the discharging without interference of additionally charging behaviour.
Figure \ref{development:discharge} shows the result.
 
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{4-development/hardware/graphics/entladen.pdf}
	\caption{Discharging behaviour.\label{development:discharge}}
\end{figure}

As soon as the load is connected (after 25\,), $V_{\text{SYS}}$ and $V_{\text{BAT}}$ first drop by almost $1\,\text{V}$ and steadily decrease subsequently.
After ca. 100 s, $V_{\text{BAT}}$ reached the value of $V_{\text{BAT\_SD}}$ and the ADP5090 switches the output off ($V_{\text{SYS}}$ drops to 0) to prevent the capacitor from overdischarging.
The output now stays switched off, until $V_{\text{IN}}$ again supplies energy, and $V_{\text{BAT}} \le V_{\text{BAT\_SD}}$.
It can also clearly be seen, that after 160\,s, the ADP5090 controls $V_{\text{IN}}$ to ca. $2.1\,\text{V}$. Recall that this is the optimal power point of the solar cell.

\subsubsection{Power Latch}
Considering the usage of an wakeup receiver, implementing a latch circuit to en-/disable the power supply is a suitable option. The first version of latch circuit designed has two control inputs. A short voltage impulse on one of these inputs en-/disables the power supply for everything except the wakeup receiver and the ADP5090. 
\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\caption{Comparison between the first and second version of the power latch to show their difference of the layout and components}
	\label{fig:pwr_layout}
\end{figure}

Since the driver board of the \acs{epd} requires a stable input voltage to run reliable, a DC-DC converter is needed to convert the minimum input voltage of $2.2\,V$ to $3.3\,V$. The used component (LMR61428) did not work properly on the first PCB due to some design flaws. Because of this a second version correcting these flaws was designed produced.
