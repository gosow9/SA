Following improvements on the prototype have to be made, before developing a complete layout of the receiver:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Developing a power management which protects the super capacitor from over discharging
	\item[-] Changing the microcontroller to display driver connection from \acs{spi} to a parallel bus (for ex. I80)
	\item[-] Synchronising of the refresh sequence on transmitter end
\end{itemize}
These adjustments should ensure functionality and reduce power consumption of the prototype.

Further it may be useful, to extend the \acs{ble}-communication to a mesh network, or even change to a different protocol with more range.
